🌸 Iris Flower Prediction App

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application built using Streamlit that predicts Iris flower species based on user-input features.

The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier and includes proper train-test splitting, model evaluation, and feature importance visualization.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

Interactive ML web app using Streamlit

Data preprocessing and train-test split

Random Forest model training

Model evaluation with accuracy score

Prediction probability display

Feature importance visualization

Deployment-ready structure

Users can adjust sepal and petal measurements through sliders, and the app predicts the Iris species in real time.
